# ipfw Preference Pane (ipfwPane)

ipfwPane gives you back control over the packet based firewall from the Tiger days.  For more user related information and downloads please visit the website at http://pixelshed.net/ipfwpane/.

The current version has the same feature set like Apple's original Preference Pane.  I am currently planing to extend the features a bit to give users who want it more control over ipfw while keeping the UI simple.  (See TODO.txt for what is planed.)

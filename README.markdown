# ipfw Preference Pane (ipfwPane)

ipfwPane is a Preference Pane for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, it gives you back control over the packet based firewall from the Tiger days.  For more information, screenshots and downloads please visit the website at [pixelshed.net/ipfwpane](http://pixelshed.net/ipfwpane/).

The current version has the same features like Apple's original Preference Pane.  I am currently planing to extend the features a bit to give users who want it more control over ipfw while keeping the UI simple.  (See TODO.txt for what is planed.)

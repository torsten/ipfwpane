# DO NOT USE THESE RULES without customizing them first!
# Version: 2007/12/12

# These rules *MUST* be customized to your requirements.
# In particular, if you have a private home network (behind an AirPort
# Base Station, Linksys WRT54G, etc.), change “10.42.24.0/24″ below to
# your private network range; duplicate rules with different ranges, if use use this computer on multiple networks.
# Additionally, allow only ports you actually use; block unused ports.

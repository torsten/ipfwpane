Reading rules from a file:

ipfw [-cnNqS] pathname

To ease configuration, rules can be put into a file which is processed
using ipfw as shown in the last synopsis line.  An absolute pathname must
be used.  The file will be read line by line and applied as arguments to
the ipfw utility.




Base rule (forbid everything):
add deny
